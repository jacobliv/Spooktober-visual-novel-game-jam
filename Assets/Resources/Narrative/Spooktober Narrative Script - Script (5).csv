[D1SG-4]	As she winks, a puff of smoke shaped like a skull rises from her pipe.	Day 1		Omar_Shocked		SG_Smirking	Physical	Outside_Apartment	[D1SG-5]				Silly_Track					Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1SG-5]	Think of me as your distant auntie. It keeps a few centuries off of me, but call me your Spooky Grimmother. It’s all the same to me.	Day 1	Spooky_Grimmother	Omar_Confused		SG_Smirking	Dialogue	Outside_Apartment	[D1SG-5a]				Silly_Track					Nighttime_Ambience

[D1C1-1]	The woman’s expression contorts to one of annoyance. She takes a puff from her pipe and lets out a sigh filled with exhaustion.	Day 1		Omar_Shocked		SG_Annoyed	Physical	Outside_Apartment	[D1SG-6]				Silly_Track					Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1SG-6]	And they say the dead aren’t loud…	Day 1	Spooky_Grimmother	Omar_Shocked		SG_Annoyed	Dialogue	Outside_Apartment	[D1O-10]				Silly_Track					Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1O-10]	What? H-how’d you do that?	Day 1	Omar	Omar_Shocked		SG_Neutral	Dialogue	Outside_Apartment	[D1SG-11]				Silly_Track					Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1C1-2]	So, Spooky Grimmother, which side of the family are you from?	Day 1	Omar	Omar_Confused		SG_Neutral	Dialogue	Outside_Apartment	[D1SG-7]				Silly_Track					Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1SG-7]	She opens her mouth to answer but stops as if she’s in a freeze frame.	Day 1		Omar_Confused		SG_Confused	Physical	Outside_Apartment	[D1SG-8]				Silly_Track					Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1SG-8]	You know, I can’t even remember at this point. I’ve helped pass on so many of the family you’re all starting to blur together.	Day 1	Spooky_Grimmother	Omar_Confused		SG_Confused	Dialogue	Outside_Apartment	[D1SG-9]				Silly_Track					Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1SG-9]	She pinches my cheeks and something that looks like dust clings to her fingertips. She cringes at the sight and dusts her hand on her dress.	Day 1		Omar_Angry		SG_Smirking	Physical	Outside_Apartment	[D1SG-10]				Silly_Track					Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1SG-10]	Sorry, hun. I’ve spent too much time in the Underworld. I haven’t had a case like yours in ages.	Day 1	Spooky_Grimmother	Omar_Confused		SG_Smirking	Dialogue	Outside_Apartment	[D1O-11]				Silly_Track					Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1O-11]	The Underworld is real?!	Day 1	Omar	Omar_Shocked		SG_Neutral	Dialogue	Outside_Apartment	[D1SG-11]				Silly_Track					Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1SG-11]	Wrong question, hun. Have you seen your reflection yet?	Day 1	Spooky_Grimmother	Omar_Shocked		SG_Stern	Dialogue	Outside_Apartment	[D1O-12]				Default_Track					Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1O-12]	No. Should I? Is something wrong?!	Day 1	Omar	Omar_Confused		SG_Stern	Dialogue	Outside_Apartment	[D1SG-12]				Default_Track					Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1SG-12]	I’m guessing you don’t recognize the smell of decay on yourself either, huh?	Day 1	Spooky_Grimmother	Omar_Confused		SG_Smirking	Dialogue	Outside_Apartment	[D1SG-13]				Default_Track					Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1SG-13]	She wiggles her finger and a hand mirror pops into her palm.	Day 1			Mirror_Item		Physical	Outside_Apartment	[D1SG-14]				Default_Track	Sparkle				Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1SG-14]	She holds it up to where I can see it. Something that could’ve been me stares back from the mirror, startling me, and makes me trip over my own feet to get away from it.	Day 1			OmarMirror_Item		Physical	Outside_Apartment	[D1O-13]				Default_Track					Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1O-13]	I put my hand over my heart to catch my breath but all I feel is a cold. No pulse. I couldn’t even feel my lungs expand. I wasn’t breathing.	Day 1			OmarMirror_Item		Physical	Outside_Apartment	[D1SG-15]				Default_Track					Nighttime_Ambience

[D1O-14]	This time I didn't scream. I stare into the mirror and trace the shape of my cheeks. With one of my nails, I scratch at my face to see if I could feel anything. There wasn’t even an ache.	Day 1			OmarMirror_Item		Physical	Outside_Apartment	[D1O-15]				Default_Track					Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1O-15]	My jaw fell to the floor. Literally.	Day 1		Omar_Shocked		SG_Neutral	Physical	Outside_Apartment	[D1O-16]				Default_Track					Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1O-16]	What the hell is going on?	Day 1	Omar	Omar_Shocked		SG_Neutral	Dialogue	Outside_Apartment	[D1SG-16]				Default_Track					Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1SG-16]	A chance to get closure.	Day 1	Spooky_Grimmother	Omar_Confused		SG_Neutral	Dialogue	Outside_Apartment	[D1SG-17]				Default_Track					Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1SG-17]	She snaps her finger and my jaw floats up before reattaching to my head.	Day 1		Omar_Confused		SG_Neutral	Physical	Outside_Apartment	[D1SG-18]				Default_Track					Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1SG-18]	If you haven’t connected the dots yet, you very much did not die from natural causes.	Day 1	Spooky_Grimmother	Omar_Shocked		SG_Neutral	Dialogue	Outside_Apartment	[D1SG-19]				Default_Track					Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1SG-19]	You were killed.	Day 1	Spooky_Grimmother	Omar_Sad		SG_Stern	Dialogue	Outside_Apartment	[D1SG-20]				Default_Track					Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1SG-20]	So, I did what any good Grimmother would do and brought you back.	Day 1	Spooky_Grimmother	Omar_Confused		SG_Stern	Dialogue	Outside_Apartment	[D1SG-21]				Default_Track					Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1SG-21]	The rotting teeth and bones peeking out from your skin are just a minor side effect. 	Day 1	Spooky_Grimmother	Omar_Confused		SG_Smirking	Dialogue	Outside_Apartment	[D1SG-21a]				Default_Track					Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1SG-21a]		Day 1	Spooky_Grimmother	Omar_Confused		SG_Smirking	Dialogue	Outside_Apartment	[D1C2-1]	I'm stuck like this?	[D1C2-2]	Bring me back to life all the way!	Default_Track						
[D1C2-1]	So...	Day 1	Omar	Omar_Sad		SG_Neutral	Dialogue	Outside_Apartment	[D1O-17]				Default_Track					Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1O-17]	This is it for me? I’m just stuck as a zombie forever?	Day 1	Omar	Omar_Sad		SG_Neutral	Dialogue	Outside_Apartment	[D1O-18]				Default_Track					Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1O-18]	My chin follows my eyes as I stare down at my hands. The skin around my skull droops and weighs down my skull. Spooky Grimmother cups my face with her hands before my head could fall onto the ground and looks me dead in the eyes.	Day 1		Omar_Sad		SG_Shocked	Physical	Outside_Apartment	[D1SG-22]				Default_Track					Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1SG-22]	H-Hey! Don’t act like that. Zombification isn’t all bad. Most people don’t get the chance to find out who whacked them, but you do!	Day 1	Spooky_Grimmother	Omar_Sad		SG_Shocked	Dialogue	Outside_Apartment	[D1SG-23]				Default_Track					Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1SG-23]	No godchild of mine is going to waste an opportunity like this by acting like a bag of bones.	Day 1	Spooky_Grimmother	Omar_Sad		SG_Smirking	Dialogue	Outside_Apartment	[D1O-23]				Default_Track					Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1C2-2]	Why would you bring me back as a zombie? I want to be normal!	Day 1	Omar	Omar_Angry		SG_Smirking	Dialogue	Outside_Apartment	[D1SG-24]				Default_Track					Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1SG-24]	That’s out of my jurisdiction sweetheart. I’m your Spooky Grimmother. Not your defy-life-and-death mother.	Day 1	Spooky_Grimmother	Omar_Angry		SG_Smirking	Dialogue	Outside_Apartment	[D1SG-25]				Default_Track					Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1SG-25]	An incomplete revival is the best I can do.	Day 1	Spooky_Grimmother	Omar_Angry		SG_Neutral	Dialogue	Outside_Apartment	[D1O-19]				Default_Track					Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1O-19]	Can’t you do it again? Like reheating pizza pockets?	Day 1	Omar	Omar_Neutral		SG_Neutral	Dialogue	Outside_Apartment	[D1SG-26]				Default_Track					Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1SG-26]	No I-- how is the reintroduction of your soul back into your body anything like reheating pizza pockets?	Day 1	Spooky_Grimmother	Omar_Neutral		SG_Annoyed	Dialogue	Outside_Apartment	[D1O-20]				Default_Track					Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1O-20]	It’s like when you bite into one right after taking it out the microwave, but then you taste how cold it is in the middle.	Day 1	Omar	Omar_Neutral		SG_Annoyed	Dialogue	Outside_Apartment	[D1O-21]				Default_Track					Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1O-21]	Obviously you can’t just keep eating it if it’s still a little frozen, so you just throw them back into the--	Day 1	Omar	Omar_Neutral		SG_Annoyed	Dialogue	Outside_Apartment	[D1SG-27]				Default_Track					Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1SG-27]	Alright, alright, we’re getting off track.	Day 1	Spooky_Grimmother	Omar_Neutral		SG_Annoyed	Dialogue	Outside_Apartment	[D1SG-28]				Default_Track					Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1SG-28]	I’m putting my foot down, hun. I can’t do it again. Your soul wouldn’t survive the process and your body would look more like worm food than it already does.	Day 1	Spooky_Grimmother	Omar_Neutral		SG_Annoyed	Dialogue	Outside_Apartment	[D1O-22]				Default_Track					Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1O-22]	I groan.	Day 1		Omar_Neutral		SG_Annoyed	Physical	Outside_Apartment	[D1SG-29]				Default_Track					Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1SG-29]	Anyway, you’re only a zombie and, if you want to find out who killed you, you’re going to stay as a zombie.	Day 1	Spooky_Grimmother	Omar_Neutral		SG_Neutral	Dialogue	Outside_Apartment	[D1O-23]				Default_Track					Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1O-23]	Well, how much time do I have to find my killer?	Day 1	Omar	Omar_Neutral		SG_Neutral	Dialogue	Outside_Apartment	[D1SG-30]				Default_Track					Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1SG-30]	Just until Halloween ends. Sooo… we’re looking at around three days. Starting now.	Day 1	Spooky_Grimmother	Omar_Shocked		SG_Neutral	Dialogue	Outside_Apartment	[D1O-24]				Default_Track					Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1O-24]	 I’m supposed to find a killer in THREE days? I don’t even remember what happened before I died!	Day 1	Omar	Omar_Shocked		SG_Annoyed	Dialogue	Outside_Apartment	[D1SG-31]				Default_Track					Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1SG-31]	Well, I wouldn’t have brought you back if it was impossible. 	Day 1	Spooky_Grimmother	SG_Annoyed		SG_Annoyed	Dialogue	Outside_Apartment	[D1O-24]				Default_Track					Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1O-24]	Where do I even start?	Day 1	Omar	Omar_Shocked		SG_Annoyed	Dialogue	Outside_Apartment	[D1O-25]				Default_Track					Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1O-25]	Bubbles of anxiety surge up from my stomach and into my shaky hands. Even though my body didn’t need it, I took in a deep breath to steady my hands and my nerves.	Day 1		Omar_Shocked		SG_Neutral	Physical	Outside_Apartment	[D1SG-32]				Default_Track					Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1SG-32]	Well, you could start by looking down.	Day 1	Spooky_Grimmother	Omar_Confused		SG_Neutral	Dialogue	Outside_Apartment	[D1O-26]				Default_Track					Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1O-26]	Down? What?	Day 1	Omar	Omar_Confused		SG_Smirking	Dialogue	Outside_Apartment	[D1O-27]				Default_Track					Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1O-27]	A 13th Pizza box lies turned over next to my feet. Whoever had ordered it must have wanted a slasher special because of all the pepperonis. The dent on it looks suspiciously like the back of my head. 	Day 1			ClosedPizza_Item		Physical	Outside_Apartment	[D1O-28]				Default_Track					Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1O-28]	A blanket lies on the ground next to my car. I must’ve thrown it off after I got up. Holding it in my hands, it’s really comfortable. Like, really comfy. On top of the handmade vibe it has going on, it’s honestly super charming.	Day 1			FoldedBlanket_Item		Physical	Outside_Apartment	[D1O-29]				Default_Track					Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1O-29]	Towards the bottom of the blanket, I run my fingers over an embroidered “L.C”.	Day 1			UnfoldedBlanket_Item		Physical	Outside_Apartment	[D1O-30]				Default_Track					Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1O-30]	L.C, huh? These must be the initials of whoever sewed the blanket.	Day 1	Omar	Omar_Neutral		SG_Smirking	Dialogue	Outside_Apartment	[D1SG-33]				Default_Track					Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1SG-33]	Ooh! See! It hasn’t even been a full day and you already got your first clue! Good job, hun!	Day 1	Spooky_Grimmother	Omar_Happy		SG_Smirking	Dialogue	Outside_Apartment	[D1O-31]				Default_Track					Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1O-31]	Thanks Spooky G, but one clue doesn’t feel like enough for me to go on at the moment though.	Day 1	Omar	Omar_Happy		SG_Smirking	Dialogue	Outside_Apartment	[D1O-32]				Default_Track					Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1O-32]	Tucking the blanket into my arms, I open the driver’s side door to my car. It’s a good thing I never lock the doors when I’m doing deliveries.	Day 1		Omar_Neutral		SG_Smirking	Physical	Outside_Apartment	[D1O-33]				Default_Track					Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1O-33]	A smile bursts onto my face when I see the keys are still in the ignition. Resting the blanket on the passenger seat, I turn the keys until the engine roars to life and then settles into it’s usual sputtering while it's parked.	Day 1		Omar_Neutral		SG_Neutral	Physical	Outside_Apartment	[D1O-34]				Default_Track					Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1O-34]	The best move for me right now would probably be to go back to work.	Day 1	Omar	Omar_Neutral		SG_Annoyed	Dialogue	Outside_Apartment	[D1SG-34]				Default_Track					Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1SG-34]	Oh sure, waste your second chance at life throwing dough in the air. Every young man’s death wish come true.	Day 1	Spooky_Grimmother	Omar_Neutral		SG_Annoyed	Dialogue	Outside_Apartment	[D1O-35]				Default_Track					Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1O-35]	Have a little more faith, Spooky G. It wouldn’t make sense for me to spend all day knocking on apartment doors and asking people if they killed me. I gotta work smarter, not harder.	Day 1	Omar	Omar_Neutral		SG_Neutral	Dialogue	Outside_Apartment	[D1O-36]				Default_Track					Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1O-36]	I figure my manager must keep receipts of any orders made online just in case we get complaints or mess up the pizzas. If I can compare the day I was killed with the last order I delivered then I’ll also have the address of the person who killed me.	Day 1	Omar	Omar_Neutral		SG_Smirking	Dialogue	Outside_Apartment	[D1SG-35]				Default_Track					Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1SG-35]	Well look at you go, Sherlock.	Day 1	Spooky_Grimmother	Omar_Happy		SG_Smirking	Dialogue	Outside_Apartment	[D1O-37]				Default_Track					Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1O-37]	I shrug but I can’t hide the pride in my smile. This is gonna be easy!	Day 1		Omar_Happy		SG_Smirking	Physical	Outside_Apartment	[D1SG-36]				Default_Track					Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1SG-36]	Or at least it would be if Spooky Grimmother wasn’t stopping me from closing the driver’s door.	Day 1		Omar_Confused		SG_Stern	Physical	Outside_Apartment	[D1SG-37]				Default_Track					Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1SG-37]	Ah, ah, ah! Hold on. I don’t want you going off on your little adventure without me telling you about Rigor Mortis.	Day 1	Spooky_Grimmother	Omar_Neutral		SG_Stern	Dialogue	Outside_Apartment	[D1O-38]				Default_Track					Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1O-38]	Rigor Mortis? Didn’t that already happen?	Day 1	Omar	Omar_Neutral		SG_Stern	Dialogue	Outside_Apartment	[D1SG-38]				Default_Track					Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1SG-38]	Not exactly, my little numbskull.	Day 1	Spooky_Grimmother	Omar_Neutral		SG_Stern	Dialogue	Outside_Apartment	[D1SG-39]				Default_Track					Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1SG-39]	You’re about halfway between a regular human and a brain-crazed cannibalistic corpse, and the only thing keeping you from going full zombie is your body.	Day 1	Spooky_Grimmother	Omar_Neutral		SG_Neutral	Dialogue	Outside_Apartment	[D1SG-40]				Default_Track					Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1SG-40]	In other words, hun, your body has a mind of its own now. If you over-exert it by running a marathon, trying to lift up a car, or anything else along those lines then your body is going to call it quits and kick out your soul.	Day 1	Spooky_Grimmother	Omar_Shocked		SG_Neutral	Dialogue	Outside_Apartment	[D1SG-41]				Default_Track					Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1SG-41]	So be careful these next three days. If you push your body too hard then you won’t even make it to Halloween. Without your soul, your body is going to start hunting for brains and the zombie apocalypse isn’t scheduled for another century.	Day 1	Spooky_Grimmother	Omar_Shocked		SG_Neutral	Dialogue	Outside_Apartment	[D1O-39]				Default_Track					Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1O-39]	I act like I’m taking a deep breath and then sigh before resting my head against the steering wheel.	Day 1		Omar_Neutral		SG_Neutral	Physical	Outside_Apartment	[D1O-40]				Default_Track					Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1O-40]	W-well what about my soul? If my body goes through rigor mortis 2.0 then my soul just gets kicked out and I’ll pass on like you said, right?	Day 1	Omar	Omar_Neutral		SG_Neutral	Dialogue	Outside_Apartment	[D1SG-42]				Default_Track					Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1SG-42]	She takes a long drag from her pipe before shaking her head.	Day 1		Omar_Neutral		SG_Stern	Physical	Outside_Apartment	[D1SG-43]				Default_Track					Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1SG-43]	Let’s just say… you’re not passing on anywhere without finishing your business.	Day 1	Spooky_Grimmother	Omar_Neutral		SG_Stern	Dialogue	Outside_Apartment	[D1SG-44]				Default_Track					Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1SG-44]	You can tell how far along you are by how hard it’ll be for you to move. It’s your body’s way of telling you to ease up.	Day 1	Spooky_Grimmother	Omar_Neutral		SG_Neutral	Dialogue	Outside_Apartment	[D1O-41]				Default_Track					Nighttime_Ambience	Rigor Mortis Meter  bar appears
[D1O-41]	I nod at her and then towards the driver’s door.	Day 1	Omar	Omar_Neutral		SG_Neutral	Physical	Outside_Apartment	[D1O-42]				Default_Track					Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1O-42]	You gonna let me go now, or is there more to tell about this seemingly shit second chance at life you’ve given me?	Day 1	Omar	Omar_Neutral		SG_Smirking	Dialogue	Outside_Apartment	[D1SG-45]				Default_Track					Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1SG-45]	Don’t get smart with me, boy. Now go on and find the unlucky punk who gets to have a zombie chasing them down.	Day 1	Spooky_Grimmother	Omar_Neutral		SG_Smirking	Dialogue	Outside_Apartment	[D1O-43]				Default_Track					Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1O-43]	She moves out of the way so I can close the driver’s door. As I check the rearview mirror, I catch a glimpse of my new zombified appearance again. I smiled when I realized I hadn’t gasped and pulled off from the parking lot towards my job: The 13th Pizza	Day 1		Omar_Neutral			Physical	Outside_Apartment	[D1O-44]				Default_Track					Nighttime_Ambience

[D1O-46]	As soon as I step through the double doors, a groan slips through my cracked lips and my shoulders slump as if my life had been snatched a second time. Ah, The 13th Pizza never makes me regret staying away.	Day 1					Physical	The_13th_Pizza	[D1O-47]				Default_Track					Electrical_Light_Ambience	
[D1O-47]	This grease trap is the infamous 13th attempt at a pizzeria by the owner, Charles Ray Lee. The guy had bad luck with running food establishments, but he wouldn’t let his pie-filled dream die. A real shame for everyone he hired.	Day 1					Physical	The_13th_Pizza	[D1I-1]				Default_Track					Electrical_Light_Ambience

[D1I-2]	Oh my God! Omar!?	Day 1	???				Dialogue	The_13th_Pizza	[D1O-48]				Default_Track					Electrical_Light_Ambience	
[D1O-48]	Before I can whip my head towards the counter, a pair of arms wrap tightly around my shoulders and pull me into a bear hug. My arms nearly pop out of their sockets along with my eyes before Iggy, my shift partner, lets me go and punches my chest.	Day 1					Physical	The_13th_Pizza	[D1I-3]				Default_Track					Electrical_Light_Ambience	
[D1I-3]	Where have you been?! You don’t call in sick to the boss, you don’t even send a text to me, and then you make me look like an asshole for calling your phone five times everyday when even your parents didn’t know where you are!

[D1O-117]	I wouldn’t let myself go unless you got it back. It’s a really cool blanket by the way. It was really nice waking up to it.	Day 1	Omar	Omar_Happy		Leah_Smile	Dialogue	Apartment_Hallway	[D1LC-11]				Default_Track					Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1LC-11]	I had knitted it myself! Anything I make always has my initials on it somewhere in case I lose it.	Day 1	Leah_Coner	Omar_Happy		Leah_Smile	Dialogue	Apartment_Hallway	[D1O-118]				Default_Track					Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1O-118]	I get comfortable by leaning against the doorframe as Leah reaches behind her door to show me more things she’s made by hand.

[D1LC-13]	I wouldn’t call it a waste at all. I saw somebody who looked cold so I gave them a way to warm up. Who better to give a blanket to than a sleeping homeless guy?	Day 1	Leah_Coner	Omar_Neutral		Leah_Smile	Dialogue	Apartment_Hallway	[D1O-120]				Default_Track					Nighttime_Ambience

[D1LC-14]	Oh! I’m sorry I didn’t mean-- it’s just I don’t know many people who just decide to fall asleep next to their car. What were you doing asleep anyway?	Day 1	Leah_Coner	Omar_Happy		Leah_Smile	Dialogue	Apartment_Hallway	[D1O-121]				Default_Track					Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1O-121]	I’m actually trying to figure that out. The past three weeks have been kind of a blur. I’ve been trying to retrace my steps all day.	Day 1	Omar	Omar_Neutral		Leah_Smile	Dialogue	Apartment_Hallway	[D1O-122]				Default_Track					Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1O-122]	You wouldn’t happen to remember somebody from The 13th Pizza delivering here around that time would you?	Day 1	Omar	Omar_Neutral		Leah_Smile	Dialogue	Apartment_Hallway	[D1LC-15]				Default_Track					Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1LC-15]	Well, I know the people above me always order pizza from you guys.	Day 1	Leah_Coner	Omar_Neutral		Leah_Confused	Dialogue	Apartment_Hallway	[D1LC-16]				Default_Track					Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1LC-16]	Come to think of it, there was a pretty bad argument between a delivery guy and one of the tenants up there. I didn’t see who since it wasn’t any of my business, you know?	Day 1	Leah_Coner	Omar_Neutral		Leah_Confused	Dialogue	Apartment_Hallway	[D1O-123]				Default_Track					Nighttime_Ambience

[D1O-124]	Totally understand. If I was in your shoes around that time, I would’ve done the same thing. Hey, I was wondering, did you maybe want this-	Day 1	Omar	Omar_Bashful		Leah_Smile	Dialogue	Apartment_Hallway	[D1O-125]				Default_Track					Nighttime_Ambience

[D1O-128]	I pull out the pizza from the bag it was nestled in.	Day 1		Omar_Happy		Leah_Confused	Physical	Apartment_Hallway	[D1O-129]				Default_Track					Nighttime_Ambience

[D1O-133]	I bolt for the stairs and instinctively toss the pizza I had in hand. Any other time I probably would have thought of that as a waste, but now isn’t the time for thinking.	Day 1		Omar_Shocked			Physical	Apartment_Hallway	[D1O-134]				Default_Track					Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1O-134]	My hands had already grabbed onto the railing before my feet could touch the stairs.

Day 1		Omar_Shocked			Physical	Apartment_Hallway	[D1O-135]				Default_Track					Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1O-135]	I was in the car and driving out of Woodsboro before I knew it. One day down, two more to go, and I’m right on track to finding my killer!

[D2O-2]	Quit smoking so close to me. I don’t like the smell of whatever it is you’ve got in that pipe, and I’d rather the customers not have their pizza smell like smoke.	Day 2	Omar	Omar_Angry		SG_Smirking	Dialogue	Inside_Car	[D2SG-1]				Default_Track					Nighttime_Ambience

[D2SG-3]	Seems like they can’t get enough of The 13th Pizza. Is the delivery close to that new girl’s place? You two seemed to hit it off. What was her name again?	Day 2	Spooky_Grimmother	Omar_Neutral		SG_Neutral	Dialogue	Inside_Car	[D2O-7]				Default_Track

[D2O-9]	Hell no. That would take half of my break and wouldn’t leave me any time for questions. I need to pick two doors and get whoever is in them to talk me through what they remember that night.	Day 2	Omar	Omar_Neutral		SG_Stern	Dialogue	Inside_Car	[D2SG-5]				Default_Track						
[D2SG-5]	And if they don’t remember anything?	Day 2	Spooky_Grimmother	Omar_Neutral		SG_Stern	Dialogue	Inside_Car	[D2O-10]				Default_Track						
[D2O-10]	Then I’m gonna pray that the walk up those stairs jog my memory. I know it’s not a lot SG, but it’s all I’ve got without any help.	Day 2	Omar	Omar_Neutral		SG_Stern	Dialogue	Inside_Car	[D2O-11]				Default_Track						
[D2O-11]	I tilted my neck and waved in her general, magical direction. A puff of smoke was her initial response as she blew it right above my head.	Day 2		Omar_Neutral		Omar_Neutral	Physical	Inside_Car	[D2SG-6]				Default_Track

[D2SG-7]	Besides if you want a tip, I suggest you fix your neck before you talk to anyone outside this car.	Day 2	Spooky_Grimmother	Omar_Neutral		SG_Smirking	Dialogue	Inside_Car	[D2O-12]				Default_Track						
[D2O-12]	As my eyes drifted down, the straining of my skin to not tear around my neck was obvious along with the fact that it was twisted a hundred-eighty degrees. I didn’t even flinch as I held my face and righted myself, stretching a bit to make sure I’d gotten it back into place properly.	Day 2		Omar_Shocked		SG_Smirking	Physical	Inside_Car	[D2SG-8]				Default_Track

[D2O-13]	<i>And just like that, she was gone. Even though she pulled at my nerves, I already missed her.

[D2O-14]	<i>I wish I felt the same about these damn stairs. Besides just the physical work, memories of my past crept back into my head like a couple of slugs.

[D2C1-1]	<i>Still ascending the stairs, I zeroed in on the voices and they immediately became clear. There weren’t two voices. Only one and it was like something straight out of a nightmare.

[D2AK-2]	The toppings are not how they looked in the photo I saw! How hard is it to follow directions?! I’m sure you guys don’t cook all those pizzas from memory?! You do? No wonder it’s atrocious.	Day 2	???	Akilla_Outraged			Dialogue	Apartment_Hallway	[D2AK-3]				Default_Track						This is Akilla's voice! (Potentially get a silhouette for her so this might be edited)

[D2O-15]	Memories of the voice retreated from my mind as I reached the third floor, and I was left shaking my head to try to get the high-pitched screech of that person out of my head. It was a woman definitely and one with a serious attitude.	Day 2		Omar_Angry			Physical	Outside_Apartment	[D2O-16]				Default_Track						
[D2O-16]	Once I had recomposed myself, the discomfort of that woman’s voice has been replaced with a teeth-gritting anger. That was definitely what my killer sounded like and for a split second, I wished I didn’t.	Day 2		Omar_Angry			Physical	Outside_Apartment	[D2C1-2]				Default_Track						
[D2C1-2]	I shut my eyes and drown out the voices with the thumping of my heels against the stairs. I feel myself grip harder onto the railing. I muster everything in my power to push back against the bubbling feeling of some kind of uneasy familiarity.  	Day 2		Omar_Confused			Physical	Outside_Apartment	[D2O-17]				Default_Track						
[D2O-17]	Whatever that was about wasn’t something I wanted to touch just yet. I’ll leave the spooky stuff to my Grimmother.	Day 2		Omar_Neutral			Internal	Outside_Apartment	[D2O-18]				Default_Track						
[D2O-18]	I step away from the railing and I roughly stop in my tracks. I look down and notice my hand is still gripping the railing. I move my hand, but my grip doesn’t lessen.	Day 2		Omar_Shocked			Physical	Outside_Apartment	[D2O-19]				Default_Track						
[D2O-19]	With my other hand, I pry my right hand off from the railing. I stretch my fingers in an attempt to see how they’re moving. They seem fine.	Day 2		Omar_Confused			Physical	Outside_Apartment	[D2O-20]				Default_Track

[D2O-21]	After a few more strides toward the doors, which I guessed were right above Leah’s, I looked at the two doors in front of me.	Day 2		Omar_Neutral			Physical	Apartment_Hallway	[D2O-22]				Default_Track						
[D2O-22]	The first door, <b>Apartment #518</b>, doesn’t have anything too special about it. A pretty generic welcome mat, a fake potted plant, and a skeletal wreath hanging from the door, most likely only there for the holidays.	Day 2		Omar_Neutral			Physical	Apartment_Hallway	[D2O-23]				Default_Track						
[D2O-23]	The second door, <b>Apartment #519</b> just had a welcome mat with an axolotl holding its middle fingers up.	Day 2		Omar_Neutral			Physical	Apartment_Hallway	[D2O-24]				Default_Track

[D2O-26]	A distant voice, sounding about as tired as I felt, echoed from behind the door.	Day 2		Omar_Neutral			Physical	Apartment_Hallway	[D2EF-1]				Default_Track						
[D2EF-1]	I’m sorry. I didn’t order any pizza.	Day 2	???	Omar_Neutral			Dialogue	Apartment_Hallway	[D2O-27]				Default_Track						
[D2O-27]	Er, I understand that. I’m actually following up on an incident that happened about three weeks ago. Would you know anything about that?	Day 2	Omar	Omar_Neutral			Dialogue	Apartment_Hallway	[D2EF-2]				Default_Track

[D2O-28]	A series of clicks and clacks come from the door as latches and locks are undone. When the door finally creaked open, the person standing in the unlit apartment looked more like a zombie than I did.	Day 2	Omar	Omar_Confused			Physical	Apartment_Hallway	[D2EF-4]				Default_Track

[D2EF-8]	There was definitely a little scuffle that happened across the hall a while ago. We love The 13th Pizza on this floor, but some of us forget that you guys aren’t just workers who do whatever we say.	Day 2	Edie_Fruguer	Omar_Neutral		Edie_Confused	Dialogue	Apartment_Hallway	[D2EF-9]				Default_Track						
[D2EF-9]	 I’d never heard anybody get so upset over a wrong order. The Slasher Special is one of my personal favorites so just hearing them screaming their head off and demanding a refund was damn near ridiculous.

[D2EF-10]	I can barely get any sleep these days so I’m usually up most nights, but even if I could sleep I don’t even think I’d be able to sleep through the screeching from that night.

[D3O-98]	I will not lose myself to this…urge. After all of this I do want one thing to remain the same.	Day 3		Omar_Neutral		Akilla_Annoyed	Internal	Akillas_Apartment	[D3O-99]										
[D3O-99]	I want to be <b>Omar.</b>	Day 3		Omar_Neutral		Akilla_Annoyed	Internal	Akillas_Apartment	[D3O-100]										
[D3O-100]	I take a deep breath, as I listen to the muted ramblings of a woman I’d spent the last three days hunting down.	Day 3		Omar_Neutral		Akilla_Annoyed	Internal	Akillas_Apartment	[D3O-101]										
[D3O-101]	All that time and all that effort just to let it all go. It doesn’t make sense, but at the same time I don’t feel any regret. I do my best to make a smile.	Day 3		Omar_Neutral		Akilla_Annoyed	Internal	Akillas_Apartment	[D3O-102]										
[D3O-102]	This is good.	Day 3	Omar	Omar_Happy		Akilla_Annoyed	Dialogue	Akillas_Apartment	[D3AK-20]										
[D3AK-20]	Good? What’s good? You’re not making any sense? Talking about something is good? The only thing good is how you’re still going to give me a refund! Talking about something good… You should be talking about the greater good!	Day 3	Akilla_Karrington	Omar_Happy		Akilla_Annoyed	Dialogue	Akillas_Apartment	[D3O-103]										
[D3O-103]	Whatever you say, Akilla. I’d say this whole wild goose chase was fun, but you’re the worst person I’ve ever met in both of my lives so I’m just going to leave.	Day 3	Omar	Omar_Neutral		Akilla_Annoyed	Dialogue	Akillas_Apartment	[D3O-104]										
[D3O-104]	I turn my back and chuck up a deuce.	Day 3		Omar_Neutral		Akilla_Annoyed	Physical	Akillas_Apartment	[D3O-105]										
[D3O-105]	Omar out! 	Day 3	Omar	Omar_Neutral		Akilla_Annoyed	Dialogue	Akillas_Apartment	[D3AK-21]										
[D3AK-21]	Hey, get back here! What about my refund!? I deserve a refund! I deserve your respect! I’m gonna call your manager! Get back here!	Day 3	Akilla_Karrington	Omar_Neutral		Akilla_Outraged	Dialogue	Akillas_Apartment	[D3O-106]										
[D3O-106]	I could still hear her voice while I was driving out of Woodsboro Apartments. I hoped that it would be the last time with a little bit of luck and a lot of me begging Iggy to not have me deliver pizzas to her apartment anymore.	Day 3		Omar_Neutral			Internal	Inside_Car	[D3O-107]										
[D3O-107]	I stumble through the doors of The 13th Pizza and plop into a chair. I see Iggy and Ms. Gin out of the corners of my ears. Their voices are melding together with the humming of the A/C overhead, but two sounds break through it all.	Day 3		Omar_Neutral			Physical	The_13th_Pizza	[D3SG-30]				Default_Track						
[D3SG-30]	Nice self-control, kiddo.	Day 3	Spooky_Grimmother	Omar_Neutral		SG_Smirking	Dialogue	The_13th_Pizza	[D3O-108]				Default_Track						
[D3O-108]	My eyes blink back the foggy haze in my vision as Spooky Grimmother becomes clearer. A yawn finds its way out of my mouth before my voice does.	Day 3		Omar_Neutral		SG_Smirking	Physical	The_13th_Pizza	[D3O-109]				Default_Track						
[D3O-109]	Oh hey, SG. I wasn’t expecting myself to go this route either, but I’m feeling pretty good about it, you know? 	Day 3	Omar	Omar_Happy		SG_Smirking	Dialogue	The_13th_Pizza	[D3O-110]				Default_Track						
[D3O-110]	Also, can Iggy and Ms. Gin see you?	Day 3	Omar	Omar_Happy		SG_Smirking	Dialogue	The_13th_Pizza	[D3O-111]				Default_Track						
[D3O-111]	She shakes her head and floats over to me so we’re face to face.	Day 3		Omar_Happy		SG_Smirking	Physical	The_13th_Pizza	[D3SG-31]				Default_Track						
[D3SG-31]	Nah, but they’ll probably see some of my coworkers once they’re on their deathbeds. Speaking of which, it’s time to move on, hun.	Day 3	Spooky_Grimmother	Omar_Happy		SG_Smirking	Dialogue	The_13th_Pizza	[D3O-112]				Default_Track						
[D3O-112]	I chuckle until my eyes get heavy. I’m not sure if it’s exhaustion or happiness, and I’m pretty sure neither is Spooky Grimmother.	Day 3		Omar_Happy		SG_Smirking	Internal	The_13th_Pizza	[D3O-113]				Default_Track						
[D3O-113]	Heh… Okay. I’m ready.	Day 3	Omar	Omar_Happy		SG_Smirking	Dialogue	Black_screen	[D3O-114]				Default_Track						
[D3O-114]	For one last time, Spooky Grimmother blows a puff of skulled shaped smoke into my face and the world around me fades like wind dispersing a fog.	Day 3		Omar_Happy		SG_Smirking	Physical	Black_screen	[D3I-1]				Default_Track

[DE-1]	I can’t fight it much longer.						Internal	Black_screen	[DE-2]										
[DE-2]	Spooky Grimmother’s words echo in my brain.						Internal	Black_screen	[DE-3]										
[DE-3]	You’re about halfway between a regular human and a brain-crazed cannibalistic corpse, and the only thing keeping you from going full zombie is your body.		Spooky_Grimmother				Dialogue	Black_screen	[DE-4]										
[DE-4]	My jaw goes slack as my body convulses and shakes. Soon I'm no longer staring down at the sidewalk but at the back of my own head. My body lets out a guttural groan and shambles away into the night, drooling as palm-sized sections of skin drop to the ground.						Physical	Black_screen	[DE-5]
