[D1O-1]	I feel like somebody should’ve warned me about how dangerous delivering pizzas could be.	Day 1	Omar	N/A	Internal	Black_screen	[D1O-2]					N/A	N/A			Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1O-2]	Little did I know, death would be delivered to ME in the most tomatoey way possible.	Day 1	Omar	N/A	Internal	Black_screen	[D1O-3]					N/A				Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1O-3]	Ugh…my head.	Day 1	Omar	N/A	Dialogue	Black_screen	[D1O-4]					N/A				Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1O-4]	I don't think I've ever had a headache this bad before. It feels like my brain was tossed into a blender with one too many nails and dumped back into my head after a good five-minute shake.	Day 1	Omar	N/A	Internal	Black_screen	[D1O-5]					N/A				Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1O-5]	SNIFF SNIFF	Day 1	Omar	N/A	Physical	Black_screen	[D1O-6]					N/A				Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1O-6]	What is that smell?	Day 1	Omar	N/A	Dialogue	Black_screen	[D1O-7]					N/A				Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1O-7]	IS THAT ME?	Day 1	Omar	Omar_Shocked	Dialogue	Outside_Apartment	[D1SG-1]				Silly_Track	N/A				Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1SG-1]	Duh. Who else could it be, silly?	Day 1	???	N/A	Dialogue	Outside_Apartment	[D1O-8]				Silly_Track	N/A				Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1O-8]	Who's there?	Day 1	Omar	Omar_Confused	Dialogue	Outside_Apartment	[D1O-9]				Silly_Track	N/A				Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1O-9]	I bolt to my feet and look around, but I don’t see anyone. 	Day 1	Omar	Omar_Confused	Physical	Outside_Apartment	[D1SG-2]				Silly_Track	Sparkle				Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1SG-2]	Hellooooooo darling~!	Day 1	Spooky_Grimmother	SG_Smirking	Dialogue	Outside_Apartment	[D1SG-3]				Silly_Track	N/A				Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1SG-3]	Ooky, kooky, and oh so fabulous.	Day 1	Spooky_Grimmother	SG_Smirking	Dialogue	Outside_Apartment	[D1SG-4]				Silly_Track	N/A				Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1SG-4]	As she winks, a puff of smoke shaped like a skull rises from her pipe.	Day 1	Spooky_Grimmother	SG_Smirking	Physical	Outside_Apartment	[D1SG-5]				Silly_Track					Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1SG-5]	Think of me as a distant auntie. It keeps a few centuries off of me, but call me your Spooky Grimmother. It’s all the same to me.	Day 1	Spooky_Grimmother	SG_Smirking	Dialogue	Outside_Apartment	[D1C1-1]	SCREAM! 	[D1C1-2]	How’d you get here?	Silly_Track					Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1C1-1]	The woman’s expression contorts to one of annoyance. She takes a puff from her pipe and lets out a sigh filled with exhaustion.	Day 1	Spooky_Grimmother	SG_Annoyed	Physical	Outside_Apartment	[D1SG-6]				Silly_Track					Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1SG-6]	And they say the dead aren’t loud…	Day 1	Spooky_Grimmother	SG_Annoyed	Dialogue	Outside_Apartment	[D1O-10]				Silly_Track					Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1O-10]	What? H-how’d you do that?	Day 1	Omar	Omar_Shocked	Dialogue	Outside_Apartment	[D1SG-11]				Silly_Track					Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1C1-2]	So, Spooky Grimmother, which side of the family are you from?	Day 1	Omar	Omar_Confused	Dialogue	Outside_Apartment	[D1SG-7]				Silly_Track					Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1SG-7]	She opens her mouth to answer but stops as if she’s in a freeze frame.	Day 1	Spooky_Grimmother	SG_Neutral	Physical	Outside_Apartment	[D1SG-8]				Silly_Track					Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1SG-8]	You know, I can’t even remember at this point. I’ve helped pass on so many of the family you’re all starting to blur together.	Day 1	Spooky_Grimmother	SG_Confused	Dialogue	Outside_Apartment	[D1SG-9]				Silly_Track					Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1SG-9]	She pinches my cheeks and something that looks like dust clings to her fingertips. She cringes at the sight and dusts her hand on her dress.	Day 1	Spooky_Grimmother	SG_Smirking	Physical	Outside_Apartment	[D1SG-10]				Silly_Track					Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1SG-10]	Sorry, hun. I’ve spent too much time in the Underworld. I haven’t had a case like yours in ages.	Day 1	Spooky_Grimmother	SG_Smirking	Dialogue	Outside_Apartment	[D1O-11]				Silly_Track					Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1O-11]	The Underworld is real?!	Day 1	Omar	Omar_Shocked	Dialogue	Outside_Apartment	[D1SG-11]				Silly_Track					Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1SG-11]	Wrong question, hun. Have you seen your reflection yet?	Day 1	Spooky_Grimmother	SG_Neutral	Dialogue	Outside_Apartment	[D1O-12]				Default_Track					Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1O-12]	No. Should I? Is something wrong?!	Day 1	Omar	Omar_Confused	Dialogue	Outside_Apartment	[D1SG-12]				Default_Track					Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1SG-12]	I’m guessing you don’t recognize the smell of decay on yourself either, huh?	Day 1	Spooky_Grimmother	SG_Smirking	Dialogue	Outside_Apartment	[D1SG-13]				Default_Track					Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1SG-13]	She wiggles her finger and a hand mirror pops into her palm.	Day 1	Spooky_Grimmother	Mirror_Item	Physical	Outside_Apartment	[D1SG-14]				Default_Track	Sparkle				Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1SG-14]	She holds it up to where I can see it. Something that could’ve been me stares back from the mirror, startling me, and makes me trip over my own feet to get away from it.	Day 1	Spooky_Grimmother	Mirror_Item	Physical	Outside_Apartment	[D1O-13]				Default_Track					Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1O-13]	I put my hand over my heart to catch my breath but all I feel is a cold. No pulse. I couldn’t even feel my lungs expand. I wasn’t breathing.	Day 1	Omar	Mirror_Item	Physical	Outside_Apartment	[D1SG-15]				Default_Track					Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1SG-15]	Honey, you’re a zombie.	Day 1	Spooky_Grimmother	SG_Neutral	Dialogue	Outside_Apartment	[D1O-14]									Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1O-14]	This time I didn't scream. I stare into the mirror and trace the shape of my cheeks. With one of my nails, I scratch at my face to see if I could feel anything. There wasn’t even an ache.	Day 1	Omar	Omar_Confused	Physical	Outside_Apartment	[D1O-15]									Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1O-15]	My jaw fell to the floor. Literally.	Day 1	Omar	Omar_Shocked	Physical	Outside_Apartment	[D1O-16]									Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1O-16]	What the hell is going on?	Day 1	Omar	Omar_Shocked	Dialogue	Outside_Apartment	[D1SG-16]									Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1SG-16]	A chance to get closure.	Day 1	Spooky_Grimmother	SG_Neutral	Dialogue	Outside_Apartment	[D1SG-17]									Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1SG-17]	She snaps her finger and my jaw floats up before reattaching to my head.	Day 1	Spooky_Grimmother	SG_Neutral	Physical	Outside_Apartment	[D1SG-18]									Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1SG-18]	If you haven’t connected the dots yet, you very much did not die from natural causes.	Day 1	Spooky_Grimmother	SG_Neutral	Dialogue	Outside_Apartment	[D1SG-19]									Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1SG-19]	You were killed.	Day 1	Spooky_Grimmother	SG_Stern	Dialogue	Outside_Apartment	[D1SG-20]									Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1SG-20]	So, I did what any good Grimmother would do and brought you back.	Day 1	Spooky_Grimmother	SG_Stern	Dialogue	Outside_Apartment	[D1SG-21]									Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1SG-21]	The rotting teeth and bones peeking out from your skin are just a minor side effect. 	Day 1	Spooky_Grimmother	SG_Smirking	Dialogue	Outside_Apartment	[D1C2-1]	I'm stuck like this?	[D1C2-2]	Bring me back to life all the way!						Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1C2-1]	So...	Day 1	Omar	Omar_Sad	Dialogue	Outside_Apartment	[D1O-17]									Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1O-17]	This is it for me? I’m just stuck as a zombie forever?	Day 1	Omar	Omar_Sad	Dialogue	Outside_Apartment	[D1O-18]									Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1O-18]	My chin follows my eyes as I stare down at my hands. The skin around my skull droops and weighs down my skull. Spooky Grimmother cups my face with her hands before my head could fall onto the ground and looks me dead in the eyes.	Day 1	Omar	Omar_Sad	Physical	Outside_Apartment	[D1SG-22]									Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1SG-22]	H-Hey! Don’t act like that. Zombification isn’t all bad. Most people don’t get the chance to find out who whacked them, but you do!	Day 1	Spooky_Grimmother	SG_Shocked	Dialogue	Outside_Apartment	[D1SG-23]									Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1SG-23]	No godchild of mine is going to waste an opportunity like this by acting like a bag of bones.	Day 1	Spooky_Grimmother	SG_Smirking	Dialogue	Outside_Apartment	[D1O-23]									Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1C2-2]	Why would you bring me back as a zombie? I want to be normal!	Day 1	Omar	Omar_Angry	Dialogue	Outside_Apartment	[D1SG-24]									Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1SG-24]	That’s out of my jurisdiction sweetheart. I’m your Spooky Grimmother. Not your defy-life-and-death mother.	Day 1	Spooky_Grimmother	SG_Smirking	Dialogue	Outside_Apartment	[D1SG-25]									Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1SG-25]	An incomplete revival is the best I can do.	Day 1	Spooky_Grimmother	SG_Neutral	Dialogue	Outside_Apartment	[D1O-19]									Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1O-19]	Can’t you do it again? Like reheating pizza pockets?	Day 1	Omar	Omar_Neutral	Dialogue	Outside_Apartment	[D1SG-26]									Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1SG-26]	No I-- how is the reintroduction of your soul back into your body anything like reheating pizza pockets?	Day 1	Spooky_Grimmother	SG_Annoyed	Dialogue	Outside_Apartment	[D1O-20]									Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1O-20]	It’s like when you bite into one right after taking it out the microwave, but then you taste how cold it is in the middle.	Day 1	Omar	Omar_Neutral	Dialogue	Outside_Apartment	[D1O-21]									Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1O-21]	Obviously you can’t just keep eating it if it’s still a little frozen, so you just throw them back into the--	Day 1	Omar	Omar_Neutral	Dialogue	Outside_Apartment	[D1SG-27]									Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1SG-27]	Alright, alright, we’re getting off track.	Day 1	Spooky_Grimmother	SG_Annoyed	Dialogue	Outside_Apartment	[D1SG-28]									Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1SG-28]	I’m putting my foot down, hun. I can’t do it again. Your soul wouldn’t survive the process and your body would look more like worm food than it already does.	Day 1	Spooky_Grimmother	SG_Annoyed	Dialogue	Outside_Apartment	[D1O-22]									Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1O-22]	I groan.	Day 1	Omar	Omar_Neutral	Physical	Outside_Apartment	[D1SG-29]									Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1SG-29]	Anyway, you’re only a zombie and, if you want to find out who killed you, you’re going to stay as a zombie.	Day 1	Spooky_Grimmother	SG_Annoyed	Dialogue	Outside_Apartment	[D1O-23]									Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1O-23]	Well, how much time do I have to find my killer?	Day 1	Omar	Omar_Neutral	Dialogue	Outside_Apartment	[D1SG-30]									Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1SG-30]	Just until Halloween ends. Sooo… we’re looking at around three days. Starting now.	Day 1	Spooky_Grimmother	SG_Neutral	Dialogue	Outside_Apartment	[D1O-24]									Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1O-24]	 I’m supposed to find a killer in THREE days? I don’t even remember what happened before I died!	Day 1	Omar	Omar_Shocked	Dialogue	Outside_Apartment	[D1SG-31]									Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1SG-31]	Well, I wouldn’t have brought you back if it was impossible. 	Day 1	Spooky_Grimmother	SG_Annoyed	Dialogue	Outside_Apartment	[D1O-24]									Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1O-24]	Where do I even start?	Day 1	Omar	Omar_Shocked	Dialogue	Outside_Apartment	[D1O-25]									Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1O-25]	Bubbles of anxiety surge up from my stomach and into my shaky hands. Even though my body didn’t need it, I took in a deep breath to steady my hands and my nerves.	Day 1	Omar	Omar_Shocked	Internal	Outside_Apartment	[D1SG-32]									Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1SG-32]	Well, you could start by looking down.	Day 1	Spooky_Grimmother	SG_Neutral	Dialogue	Outside_Apartment	[D1O-26]									Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1O-26]	Down? What?	Day 1	Omar	Omar_Confused	Dialogue	Outside_Apartment	[D1O-27]									Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1O-27]	A 13th Pizza box lies turned over next to my feet. Whoever had ordered it must have wanted a slasher special because of all the pepperonis. The dent on it looks suspiciously like the back of my head. 	Day 1	Omar	ClosedPizza_Item	Physical	Outside_Apartment	[D1O-28]									Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1O-28]	A blanket lies on the ground next to my car. I must’ve thrown it off after I got up. Holding it in my hands, it’s really comfortable. Like, really comfy. On top of the handmade vibe it has going on, it’s honestly super charming.	Day 1	Omar	UnfoldedBlanket_Item	Physical	Outside_Apartment	[D1O-29]									Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1O-29]	Towards the bottom of the blanket, I run my fingers over an embroidered “L.C”.	Day 1	Omar	UnfoldedBlanket_Item	Physical	Outside_Apartment	[D1O-30]									Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1O-30]	L.C, huh? These must be the initials of whoever sewed the blanket.	Day 1	Omar	Omar_Neutral	Dialogue	Outside_Apartment	[D1SG-33]									Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1SG-33]	Ooh! See! It hasn’t even been a full day and you already got your first clue! Good job, hun!	Day 1	Spooky_Grimmother	SG_Smirking	Dialogue	Outside_Apartment	[D1O-31]									Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1O-31]	Thanks Spooky G, but one clue doesn’t feel like enough for me to go on at the moment though.	Day 1	Omar	Omar_Confused	Dialogue	Outside_Apartment	[D1O-32]									Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1O-32]	Tucking the blanket into my arms, I open the driver’s side door to my car. It’s a good thing I never lock the doors when I’m doing deliveries.	Day 1	Omar	Omar_Neutral	Physical	Outside_Apartment	[D1O-33]									Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1O-33]	A smile bursts onto my face when I see the keys are still in the ignition. Resting the blanket on the passenger seat, I turn the keys until the engine roars to life and then settles into it’s usual sputtering while it's parked.	Day 1	Omar	Omar_Neutral	Physical	Outside_Apartment	[D1O-34]									Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1O-34]	The best move for me right now would probably be to go back to work.	Day 1	Omar	Omar_Neutral	Dialogue	Outside_Apartment	[D1SG-34]									Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1SG-34]	Oh sure, waste your second chance at life throwing dough in the air. Every young man’s death wish come true.	Day 1	Spooky_Grimmother	SG_Annoyed	Dialogue	Outside_Apartment	[D1O-35]									Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1O-35]	Have a little more faith, Spooky G. It wouldn’t make sense for me to spend all day knocking on apartment doors and asking people if they killed me. I gotta work smarter, not harder.	Day 1	Omar	Omar_Neutral	Dialogue	Outside_Apartment	[D1O-36]									Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1O-36]	I figure my manager must keep receipts of any orders made online just in case we get complaints or mess up the pizzas. If I can compare the day I was killed with the last order I delivered then I’ll also have the address of the person who killed me.	Day 1	Omar	Omar_Neutral	Dialogue	Outside_Apartment	[D1SG-35]									Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1SG-35]	Well look at you go, Sherlock.	Day 1	Spooky_Grimmother	SG_Smirking	Dialogue	Outside_Apartment	[D1O-37]									Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1O-37]	I shrug but I can’t hide the pride in my smile. This is gonna be easy!	Day 1	Omar	Omar_Happy	Physical	Outside_Apartment	[D1SG-36]									Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1SG-36]	Or at least it would be if Spooky Grimmother wasn’t stopping me from closing the driver’s door.	Day 1	Spooky_Grimmother	SG_Smirking	Physical	Outside_Apartment	[D1SG-37]									Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1SG-37]	Ah, ah, ah! Hold on. I don’t want you going off on your little adventure without me telling you about Rigor Mortis.	Day 1	Spooky_Grimmother	SG_Stern	Dialogue	Outside_Apartment	[D1O-38]									Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1O-38]	Rigor Mortis? Didn’t that already happen?	Day 1	Omar	Omar_Neutral	Dialogue	Outside_Apartment	[D1SG-38]									Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1SG-38]	Not exactly, my little numbskull.	Day 1	Spooky_Grimmother	SG_Stern	Dialogue	Outside_Apartment	[D1SG-39]									Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1SG-39]	You’re about halfway between a regular human and a brain-crazed cannibalistic corpse, and the only thing keeping you from going full zombie is your body.	Day 1	Spooky_Grimmother	SG_Neutral	Dialogue	Outside_Apartment	[D1SG-40]									Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1SG-40]	In other words, hun, your body has a mind of its own now. If you over-exert it by running a marathon, trying to lift up a car, or anything else along those lines then your body is going to call it quits and kick out your soul.	Day 1	Spooky_Grimmother	SG_Neutral	Dialogue	Outside_Apartment	[D1SG-41]									Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1SG-41]	So be careful these next three days. If you push your body too hard then you won’t even make it to Halloween. Without your soul, your body is going to start hunting for brains and the zombie apocalypse isn’t scheduled for another century.	Day 1	Spooky_Grimmother	SG_Neutral	Dialogue	Outside_Apartment	[D1O-39]									Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1O-39]	I act like I’m taking a deep breath and then sigh before resting my head against the steering wheel.	Day 1	Omar	Omar_Neutral	Physical	Outside_Apartment	[D1O-40]									Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1O-40]	W-well what about my soul? If my body goes through rigor mortis 2.0 then my soul just gets kicked out and I’ll pass on like you said, right?	Day 1	Omar	Omar_Shocked	Dialogue	Outside_Apartment	[D1SG-42]									Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1SG-42]	She takes a long drag from her pipe before shaking her head.	Day 1	Spooky_Grimmother	SG_Neutral	Physical	Outside_Apartment	[D1SG-43]									Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1SG-43]	Let’s just say… you’re not passing on anywhere without finishing your business.	Day 1	Spooky_Grimmother	SG_Stern	Dialogue	Outside_Apartment	[D1SG-44]									Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1SG-44]	You can tell how far along you are by how hard it’ll be for you to move. It’s your body’s way of telling you to ease up.	Day 1	Spooky_Grimmother	SG_Neutral	Dialogue	Outside_Apartment	[D1O-41]									Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1O-41]	I nod at her and then towards the driver’s door.	Day 1	Omar	Omar_Neutral	Dialogue	Outside_Apartment	[D1O-42]									Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1O-42]	You gonna let me go now, or is there more to tell about this seemingly shit second chance at life you’ve given me?	Day 1	Omar	Omar_Neutral	Dialogue	Outside_Apartment	[D1SG-45]									Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1SG-45]	Don’t get smart with me, boy. Now go on and find the unlucky punk who gets to have a zombie chasing them down.	Day 1	Spooky_Grimmother	SG_Smirking	Dialogue	Outside_Apartment	[D1O-43]									Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1O-43]	She moves out of the way so I can close the driver’s door. As I check the rearview mirror, I catch a glimpse of my new zombified appearance again. I smiled when I realized I hadn’t gasped and pulled off from the parking lot towards my job: The 13th Pizza	Day 1	Omar	Omar_Neutral	Physical	Outside_Apartment	[D1O-44]									Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1O-44]		Day 1	Omar	N/A	Internal	Black_screen	[D1O-45]									Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1O-45]		Day 1	Omar	N/A	Internal	The_13th_Pizza	[D1O-46]					Door_Entry_Chime	N/A			Electrical_Light_Ambience	
[D1O-46]	As soon as I step through the double doors, a groan slips through my cracked lips and my shoulders slump as if my life had been snatched a second time. Ah, The 13th Pizza never makes me regret staying away.	Day 1	Omar	N/A	Physical	The_13th_Pizza	[D1O-47]									Electrical_Light_Ambience	
[D1O-47]	This grease trap is the infamous 13th attempt at a pizzeria by the owner, Charles Ray Lee. The guy had bad luck with running food establishments, but he wouldn’t let his pie-filled dream die. A real shame for everyone he hired.	Day 1	Omar	N/A	Internal	The_13th_Pizza	[D1I-1]									Electrical_Light_Ambience	
[D1I-1]	A high-pitched voice tinged with voice cracks breaks the humming of the A/C Charles didn’t fix.	Day 1	???	N/A	Physical	The_13th_Pizza	[D1I-2]									Electrical_Light_Ambience	
[D1I-2]	Oh my God! Omar!?	Day 1	???	N/A	Dialogue	The_13th_Pizza	[D1O-48]									Electrical_Light_Ambience	
[D1O-48]	Before I can whip my head towards the counter, a pair of arms wrap tightly around my shoulders and pull me into a bear hug. My arms nearly pop out of their sockets along with my eyes before Iggy, my shift partner, lets me go and punches my chest.	Day 1	Omar	N/A	Physical	The_13th_Pizza	[D1I-3]									Electrical_Light_Ambience	
[D1I-3]	Where have you been?! You don’t call in sick to the boss, you don’t even send a text to me, and then you make me look like an asshole for calling your phone five times everyday when even your parents didn’t know where you are!	Day 1	Iggy_Bumdeez	Iggy_Fuming	Dialogue	The_13th_Pizza	[D1I-4]									Electrical_Light_Ambience	
[D1I-4]	How’re you just going to ghost everyone for three weeks?!	Day 1	Iggy_Bumdeez	Iggy_Fuming	Dialogue	The_13th_Pizza	[D1O-49]									Electrical_Light_Ambience	
[D1O-49]	Three weeks?! I’ve been gone for three weeks?!	Day 1	Omar	Omar_Shocked	Dialogue	The_13th_Pizza	[D1I-5]									Electrical_Light_Ambience	
[D1I-5]	Duh! Did you lose track of time while you were on your ghost vacation?! You owe me big time! And then you have the audacity to walk in here like a…	Day 1	Iggy_Bumdeez	Iggy_Fuming	Dialogue	The_13th_Pizza	[D1I-6]									Electrical_Light_Ambience	
[D1I-6]	He sniffs the air and twitches his nose to hold back his disgust. 	Day 1	Iggy_Bumdeez	Iggy_Neutral	Physical	The_13th_Pizza	[D1I-7]									Electrical_Light_Ambience	
[D1I-7]	 Dude, you’re smelling a little ripe. I can give you some of the deodorant in my bag, but I want an answer first. What happened?	Day 1	Iggy_Bumdeez	Iggy_Neutral	Dialogue	The_13th_Pizza	[D1C3-1]	Avoid the Question	[D1C3-2]	Tell the Truth						Electrical_Light_Ambience	
[D1C3-1]	I wrap my arms around his neck and shove his nose closer to my armpits so he can get a good whiff of me. We both laugh it off as he shoves me away and stare at each other as we wear the same smile.	Day 1	Omar	Omar_Happy	Physical	The_13th_Pizza	[D1O-50]									Electrical_Light_Ambience	
[D1O-50]	I missed you too, Ig. Really appreciate the warm welcome.	Day 1	Omar	Omar_Happy	Dialogue	The_13th_Pizza	[D1I-8]									Electrical_Light_Ambience	
[D1I-8]	Yeah, yeah, yeah. Stop dodging the question though, man.	Day 1	Iggy_Bumdeez	Iggy_Excited	Dialogue	The_13th_Pizza	[D1O-51]									Electrical_Light_Ambience	
[D1O-51]	I’m not dodging, I’m not dodging. I’m still trying to figure out what happened to me. The last few weeks are kind of a blur, and definitely not in a fun way.	Day 1	Omar	Omar_Happy	Dialogue	The_13th_Pizza	[D1I-9]									Electrical_Light_Ambience	
[D1I-9]	That’s some hangover, man. If you drank as much as I thought, I’m surprised you’re still standing. Did something happen with your parents? You need to crash with me again?	Day 1	Iggy_Bumdeez	Iggy_Neutral	Dialogue	The_13th_Pizza	[D1O-52]									Electrical_Light_Ambience	
[D1O-52]	Oh no, I’m good. I’m just trying to piece some things together.	Day 1	Omar	Omar_Neutral	Dialogue	The_13th_Pizza	[D1O-53]									Electrical_Light_Ambience	
[D1O-53]	I really appreciate you covering for me, man. I don’t know how you did it, but I-	Day 1	Omar	Omar_Neutral	Dialogue	The_13th_Pizza	[D1I-10]									Electrical_Light_Ambience	
[D1I-10]	Iggy shakes his head to cut me off and raises his hand. Like we’d done probably a million times before, I give him a high five and finish our signature handshake with a fist bump.	Day 1	Iggy_Bumdeez	Iggy_Neutral	Physical	The_13th_Pizza	[D1I-11]									Electrical_Light_Ambience	
[D1I-11]	Don’t even worry about it. When you didn’t show up for your shift, I volunteered to cover for you until you came back before Charles could even write up the new schedule.	Day 1	Iggy_Bumdeez	Iggy_Neutral	Dialogue	The_13th_Pizza	[D1I-12]									Electrical_Light_Ambience	
[D1I-12]	You still owe me, though.	Day 1	Iggy_Bumdeez	Iggy_Excited	Dialogue	The_13th_Pizza	[D1O-54]									Electrical_Light_Ambience	
[D1O-54]	Let me know soon so I won’t forget. I don’t need you holding this over my head.	Day 1	Omar	Omar_Happy	Dialogue	The_13th_Pizza	[D1O-55]									Electrical_Light_Ambience	
[D1O-55]	Our laughs fill the restaurant as we make our way behind the register.	Day 1	Omar	Omar_Happy	Physical	The_13th_Pizza	[D1O-56]									Electrical_Light_Ambience	
[D1O-56]	It was like I’d never left.	Day 1	Omar	Omar_Happy	Internal	The_13th_Pizza	[D1O-68]									Electrical_Light_Ambience	
[D1C3-2]	Well…	Day 1	Omar	Omar_Confused	Dialogue	The_13th_Pizza	[D1O-57]									Electrical_Light_Ambience	
[D1O-57]	Basically, I died and got brought back to life by a spooky, grim godmother I never knew I had. I’m guessing that I died three weeks ago while I was on my shift, but I don’t remember who did it.	Day 1	Omar	Omar_Bashful	Dialogue	The_13th_Pizza	[D1O-58]									Electrical_Light_Ambience	
[D1O-58]	My Spooky Grimmother says that I only have until Halloween night to figure out who killed me or else I’m gonna be stuck as a ghost and my body will start the zombie apocalypse that’s due sometime in the 23rd century.	Day 1	Omar	Omar_Bashful	Dialogue	The_13th_Pizza	[D1I-13]									Electrical_Light_Ambience	
[D1I-13]	He stares at me with his hands holding onto something in his pockets. I scratch my hair to distract myself from the silence and his eyes.	Day 1	Iggy_Bumdeez	Iggy_Neutral	Physical	The_13th_Pizza	[D1O-59]									Electrical_Light_Ambience	
[D1O-59]	That’s pretty much everything I know. I came back here to see if I could get any clues about what happened to me.	Day 1	Omar	Omar_Bashful	Dialogue	The_13th_Pizza	[D1I-14]									Electrical_Light_Ambience	
[D1I-14]	He stomps behind the counter.	Day 1	Iggy_Bumdeez	Iggy_Fuming	Physical	The_13th_Pizza	[D1I-15]									Electrical_Light_Ambience	
[D1I-15]	Is it so hard for you to tell me the truth?!	Day 1	Iggy_Bumdeez	Iggy_Fuming	Dialogue	The_13th_Pizza	[D1O-60]									Electrical_Light_Ambience	
[D1O-60]	Ig, I am telling you the truth.	Day 1	Omar	Omar_Sad	Dialogue	The_13th_Pizza	[D1I-16]									Electrical_Light_Ambience	
[D1I-16]	Whatever, man.	Day 1	Iggy_Bumdeez	Iggy_Neutral	Dialogue	The_13th_Pizza	[D1O-61]									Electrical_Light_Ambience	
[D1O-61]	Iggy, please. You’ve got to believe me.	Day 1	Omar	Omar_Sad	Dialogue	The_13th_Pizza	[D1O-62]									Electrical_Light_Ambience	
[D1O-62]	You said I’ve been gone for three weeks right? I don’t remember anything from that time! The last thing I remember is saying goodbye to you and Ms. Gin before I drove off to drop off the deliveries.	Day 1	Omar	Omar_Sad	Dialogue	The_13th_Pizza	[D1O-63]									Electrical_Light_Ambience	
[D1O-63]	I fall to my knees in front of the counter and press my forehead against the dust-covered floor.	Day 1	Omar	Omar_Sad	Physical	The_13th_Pizza	[D1O-64]									Electrical_Light_Ambience	
[D1O-64]	Iggy, I’m begging you! I need you to believe me on this! I’m on my knees, man!	Day 1	Omar	Omar_Sad	Dialogue	The_13th_Pizza	[D1I-17]									Electrical_Light_Ambience	
[D1I-17]	Iggy crosses his arms and grumbles. I can see the thoughts churning in his head, but whether he’ll believe me is still a coin toss.	Day 1	Iggy_Bumdeez	Iggy_Neutral	Physical	The_13th_Pizza	[D1-18]									Electrical_Light_Ambience	
[D1-18]	Ugh.	Day 1	Iggy_Bumdeez	Iggy_Neutral	Dialogue	The_13th_Pizza	[D1I-19]									Electrical_Light_Ambience	
[D1I-19]	He sighs into a relaxed smirk.	Day 1	Iggy_Bumdeez	Iggy_Neutral	Physical	The_13th_Pizza	[D1I-20]									Electrical_Light_Ambience	
[D1I-20]	I don’t know if I believe you, but I’ll play along cuz we’re bros. Just remember you owe me.	Day 1	Iggy_Bumdeez	Iggy_Neutral	Dialogue	The_13th_Pizza	[D1O-65]									Electrical_Light_Ambience	
[D1O-65]	Thank you, thank you, thank you!	Day 1	Omar	Omar_Happy	Dialogue	The_13th_Pizza	[D1O-66]									Electrical_Light_Ambience	
[D1O-66]	I tackled him with the tightest hug I could muster until I felt my arm start to pop out of place. Iggy shoved me off so he must not have noticed.	Day 1	Omar	Omar_Neutral	Physical	The_13th_Pizza	[D1I-21]									Electrical_Light_Ambience	
[D1I-21]	I know, I know, I’m pretty awesome. Come on.	Day 1	Iggy_Bumdeez	Iggy_Neutral	Dialogue	The_13th_Pizza	[D1O-67]									Electrical_Light_Ambience	
[D1O-67]	I follow him behind the register with a dumb grin on my face. It was like I’d never left.	Day 1	Omar	Omar_Happy	Physical	The_13th_Pizza	[D1O-68]									Electrical_Light_Ambience	
[D1O-68]	Alright, where’s our lovely manager?	Day 1	Omar	Omar_Neutral	Dialogue	The_13th_Pizza	[D1I-22]									Electrical_Light_Ambience	
[D1I-22]	Oh, Rudy called in sick today.	Day 1	Iggy_Bumdeez	Iggy_Neutral	Dialogue	The_13th_Pizza	[D1O-69]									Electrical_Light_Ambience	
[D1O-69]	The one day I actually want to see his face and he’s gone. Just my luck…	Day 1	Omar	Omar_Neutral	Dialogue	The_13th_Pizza	[D1G-1]									Electrical_Light_Ambience	
[D1G-1]	A kind-hearted old lady with a smile on her face and quarters jingling in her pocket walks up to the counter. I’m already smiling before I realize who it is.	Day 1	Ms_Gin	Gin_Smile	Physical	The_13th_Pizza	[D1O-70]					Door_Entry_Chime	Door_Open			Electrical_Light_Ambience	
[D1O-70]	Ms. Gin! How’s my favorite customer?	Day 1	Omar	Omar_Happy	Dialogue	The_13th_Pizza	[D1G-2]									Electrical_Light_Ambience	
[D1G-2]	Her laugh is like a warm pie during Christmas. 	Day 1	Ms_Gin	Gin_Smile	Physical	The_13th_Pizza	[D1G-3]									Electrical_Light_Ambience	
[D1G-3]	Omar! I thought you quit and ran for the hills. It’s been ages since I’ve seen you!	Day 1	Ms_Gin	Gin_Smile	Dialogue	The_13th_Pizza	[D1O-71]									Electrical_Light_Ambience	
[D1O-71]	I chuckle awkwardly. It doesn’t seem like a good idea to tell her I’ve just been dead for three weeks.	Day 1	Omar	Omar_Bashful	Physical	The_13th_Pizza	[D1O-72]									Electrical_Light_Ambience	
[D1O-72]	Just been feeling a bit under the weather. I bounce back pretty easy, ma’am!	Day 1	Omar	Omar_Bashful	Dialogue	The_13th_Pizza	[D1G-4]									Electrical_Light_Ambience	
[D1G-4]	I hope so dear. You look a few steps from death still! Maybe another few days off would have done you some extra good.	Day 1	Ms_Gin	Gin_Pondering	Dialogue	The_13th_Pizza	[D1O-73]									Electrical_Light_Ambience	
[D1O-73]	Thanks for the concern, ma’am. Trust me, I’ll be fine!	Day 1	Omar	Omar_Happy	Dialogue	The_13th_Pizza	[D1O-74]									Electrical_Light_Ambience	
[D1O-74]	I hope at least.	Day 1	Omar	Omar_Sad	Dialogue	The_13th_Pizza	[D1G-5]									Electrical_Light_Ambience	
[D1G-5]	Ms. Gin stares into my face the way only a mother could give when she’s looking to see if there is anything wrong with you.	Day 1	Ms_Gin	Gin_Pondering	Physical	The_13th_Pizza	[D1O-75]									Electrical_Light_Ambience	
[D1O-75]	Uh… You’re kind of freaking me out, Ms. Gin.	Day 1	Omar	Omar_Confused	Dialogue	The_13th_Pizza	[D1G-6]									Electrical_Light_Ambience	
[D1G-6]	Sorry, Omar. I just feel like something is different about you. Are you doing something different with your hair?	Day 1	Ms_Gin	Gin_Pondering	Dialogue	The_13th_Pizza	[D1I-23]									Electrical_Light_Ambience	
[D1I-23]	OOOOOOH!!!	Day 1	Iggy_Bumdeez	Iggy_Excited	Dialogue	The_13th_Pizza	[D1I-24]									Electrical_Light_Ambience	
[D1I-24]	She’s on your head, Mar-Mar.	Day 1	Iggy_Bumdeez	Iggy_Excited	Dialogue	The_13th_Pizza	[D1O-76]									Electrical_Light_Ambience	
[D1O-76]	Oh, hush. I’m still me and that’s all that matters. 	Day 1	Omar	Omar_Neutral	Dialogue	The_13th_Pizza	[D1O-77]									Electrical_Light_Ambience	
[D1O-77]	You came here for the usual, Ms. G?	Day 1	Omar	Omar_Happy	Dialogue	The_13th_Pizza	[D1O-78]									Electrical_Light_Ambience	
[D1O-78]	Just as I slide her over an empty small cup the eighty-five cents in her pocket are already on the counter.	Day 1	Omar	Omar_Happy	Physical	The_13th_Pizza	[D1G-7]									Electrical_Light_Ambience	
[D1G-7]	Thank you, dear. You know when you told me you were heading over to The Woodsboro Apartments I thought you’d never come back.	Day 1	Ms_Gin	Gin_Smile	Dialogue	The_13th_Pizza	[D1O-79]									Electrical_Light_Ambience	
[D1O-79]	My eyes shoot up from the cash register as I shove it closed.	Day 1	Omar	Omar_Shocked	Physical	The_13th_Pizza	[D1O-80]									Electrical_Light_Ambience	
[D1O-80]	The Woodsboro Apartments? The place where security never sleeps?	Day 1	Omar	Omar_Shocked	Dialogue	The_13th_Pizza	[D1G-8]									Electrical_Light_Ambience	
[D1G-8]	Something like that. It's quite a stuffy-looking place to me. You were handling deliveries there if my memory serves me right.	Day 1	Ms_Gin	Gin_Pondering	Dialogue	The_13th_Pizza	[D1I-25]									Electrical_Light_Ambience	
[D1I-25]	Oh! Hey, since you’re not dead in a ditch somewhere that reminds me. You’re on schedule tonight, dude.	Day 1	Iggy_Bumdeez	Iggy_Neutral	Dialogue	The_13th_Pizza	[D1O-81]									Electrical_Light_Ambience	
[D1O-81]	Of course, I am…	Day 1	Omar	Omar_Sad	Dialogue	The_13th_Pizza	[D1O-82]									Electrical_Light_Ambience	
[D1O-82]	It was hard to report to work as usual as if I’m not a zombie. There was something very normal about the mundanity of the shift. I get a pizza, I deliver, I pray I get a tip, and repeat.	Day 1	Omar	N/A	Internal	Black_screen	[D1O-83]									Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1O-83]	The next few hours had me looking at the rest of my day as a stopwatch, and I was counting down the minutes until I could take my break and head over to Woodsboro Apartments.	Day 1	Omar	N/A	Internal	Black_screen	[D1O-84]									Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1O-84]	I had told Iggy that I’d be taking a break at my usual spot before I left, and, as usual, he handed me a 10-inch slasher special pizza. They’re sweet. It’s usually a pizza I’d get to eat on break if I was in the mood for one.	Day 1	Omar	ClosedPizza_Item	Internal	Inside_Car	[D1O-85]									Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1O-85]	I open the pizza box to get a good whiff of the saucy goodness I’m usually happy to breathe in.	Day 1	Omar	OpenPizza_Item	Internal	Inside_Car	[D1O-86]									Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1O-86]	Nothing.	Day 1	Omar	OpenPizza_Item	Internal	Inside_Car	[D1O-87]									Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1O-87]	Even the smell of greasy cheap pizza didn’t stir me. If I had an appetite for anything it's not for pizza anymore. 	Day 1	Omar	OpenPizza_Item	Internal	Inside_Car	[D1O-88]									Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1O-88]	The next few hours had me looking at the rest of my day as a stopwatch, and I was counting down the minutes until I could take my break and head over to Woodsboro Apartments. My complimentary pizza still rested on the back seat of my car as I pulled up to the gate.	Day 1	Omar	OpenPizza_Item	Physical	Inside_Car	[D1O-89]									Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1O-89]	I reach into the backseat and grab the mystery blanket I woke up with. Somehow it still feels rather cozy.	Day 1	Omar	UnfoldedBlanket_Item	Physical	Inside_Car	[D1O-90]									Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1O-90]	Alright, back here again…	Day 1	Omar	Omar_Neutral	Dialogue	Inside_Car	[D1SG-46]									Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1SG-46]	Well, I could’ve told you that much dear.	Day 1	Spooky_Grimmother	SG_Smirking	Dialogue	Inside_Car	[D1O-91]					Sparkle				Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1O-91]	Ah!	Day 1	Omar	Omar_Shocked	Dialogue	Inside_Car	[D1O-92]									Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1O-92]	I jump out of my skin and let out a harsh breath through my nose to calm myself down.	Day 1	Omar	Omar_Shocked	Physical	Inside_Car	[D1O-93]									Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1O-93]	Please stop doing that-- sparkle thing!	Day 1	Omar	Omar_Shocked	Dialogue	Inside_Car	[D1SG-47]									Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1SG-47]	I’m sorry, next time I’ll make sure I poof in a glorious display of hellfire and the screams of the damned.	Day 1	Spooky_Grimmother	SG_Annoyed	Dialogue	Inside_Car	[D1O-94]									Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1O-94]	I narrow my eyes at her as sarcasm drips from her voice. My attention moves toward the apartment registry.	Day 1	Omar	Omar_Neutral	Physical	Inside_Car	[D1O-95]									Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1O-95]	Alright, Ms. Gin said this was the last place I was heading to make a delivery. I’m betting the killer lives in this apartment complex. Since I only have this blanket, I might as well make it worth it.	Day 1	Omar	Omar_Neutral	Dialogue	Inside_Car	[D1O-96]									Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1O-96]	Maybe the initials on the blanket are the same as someone on the registry. If I find the right person then I can just say I’m returning the blanket and they’ll let me in. Best case scenario they can tell me about how I died.	Day 1	Omar	FoldedBlanket_Item	Dialogue	Inside_Car	[D1SG-48]									Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1SG-48]	I don’t know, I’d tell you to leave it downstairs if someone tried to do that for me.	Day 1	Spooky_Grimmother	SG_Smirking	Dialogue	Inside_Car	[D1O-97]									Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1O-97]	I’m ignoring you now.	Day 1	Omar	Omar_Neutral	Dialogue	Inside_Car	[D1O-98]									Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1O-98]	I huff as I press the down arrow until I make it towards the L names.	Day 1	Omar	Omar_Neutral	Physical	Inside_Car	[D1O-99]									Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1O-99]	Only two L.C.’s? L. Coner and L. Cloverfield. I’ll have to make a guess here.	Day 1	Omar	Omar_Neutral	Dialogue	Inside_Car	[D1C4-1]	L. Coner	[D1C4-2]	L. Cloverfield						Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1C4-1]	A feminine sing-songy voice comes through the intercom’s static.	Day 1	???	N/A	Physical	Inside_Car	[D1LC-1]									Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1LC-1]	Hello~	Day 1	Leah_Coner	N/A	Dialogue	Inside_Car	[D1O-100]					Intercom_Buzz				Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1O-100]	Uh, hi! I’m Omar. I’m with The 13th Pizza. I think I have your blanket. It’s blue and it has your initials on it.	Day 1	Omar	Omar_Neutral	Dialogue	Inside_Car	[D1LC-2]									Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1LC-2]	Oh, my blanket! Explains why you were sleeping next to the pizza delivery car.	Day 1	Leah_Coner	N/A	Dialogue	Inside_Car	[D1O-101]									Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1O-101]	Her voice, and the laugh that followed it, tickle my heart and guide a laugh of my own from underneath my focus.	Day 1	Omar	Omar_Bashful	Physical	Inside_Car	[D1O-102]									Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1O-102]	I uh… Yeah, I really appreciated it. I appreciate it so much that I wanted to come by and give it back to you. Ha ha…	Day 1	Omar	Omar_Bashful	Dialogue	Inside_Car	[D1LC-3]									Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1LC-3]	Oh, that’s super nice of you! As long as you’re not some murder hobo with a knife I guess I can accept that as you actually wanting to buzz you in.	Day 1	Leah_Coner	Omar_Happy	Dialogue	Inside_Car	[D1LC-4]									Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1LC-4]	Come on through. I’m on the second floor of apartment 418.	Day 1	Leah_Coner	Omar_Happy	Dialogue	Inside_Car	[D1O-109]									Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1C4-2]	Like gravel sliding down a chalkboard, a voice pushes past the static. 	Day 1	???	N/A	Physical	Inside_Car	[D1GM-1]					Intercom_Buzz				Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1GM-1]	What do you want?	Day 1	Grumpy_Old_Man	N/A	Dialogue	Inside_Car	[D1O-103]									Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1O-103]	Um… I want to return a blanket?	Day 1	Omar	Omar_Neutral	Dialogue	Inside_Car	[D1GM-2]									Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1GM-2]	I ain’t got no blanket.	Day 1	Grumpy_Old_Man	N/A	Dialogue	Inside_Car	[D1O-104]									Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1O-104]	Well, sir, I have a blanket here that has the initials L.C. on it and I’m just trying to return it.	Day 1	Omar	Omar_Neutral	Dialogue	Inside_Car	[D1GM-3]									Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1GM-3]	I’m not interested in whatever you’re selling! You already got my social security number!	Day 1	Grumpy_Old_Man	N/A	Dialogue	Inside_Car	[D1O-105]									Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1O-105]	Sir, I’m just trying to return--	Day 1	Omar	Omar_Neutral	Dialogue	Inside_Car	[D1O-106]									Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1O-106]	No answer. I shift uncomfortably.	Day 1	Omar	Omar_Neutral	Physical	Inside_Car	[D1O-107]									Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1O-107]	…Hello?	Day 1	Omar	Omar_Confused	Dialogue	Inside_Car	[D1O-108]									Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1O-108]	Hope he gets that social security problem fixed. I pray the other person happened to have left a blanket out in a parking lot somewhere.	Day 1	Omar	Omar_Neutral	Internal	Inside_Car	[D1C4-1]									Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1O-109]	After the intercom buzzes, the gears in the gate whirl, and eventually open enough for me to pass through, I end up finding her apartment once I scale the stairs to the second floor. With my pizza in one hand and the blanket in the other, I give the door a few soft knocks.	Day 1	Omar	Omar_Bashful	Physical	Apartment_Hallway	[D1O-110]									Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1O-110]	Ms. Coner? It’s Omar with The 13th Pizza.	Day 1	Omar	Omar_Bashful	Dialogue	Apartment_Hallway	[D1LC-5]									Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1LC-5]	Coming!	Day 1	Leah_Coner	N/A	Dialogue	Apartment_Hallway	[D1O-111]									Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1O-111]	The apartment door swings wide open and I finally put a face to the most memorable voice I’d ever heard. 	Day 1	Omar	Omar_Bashful	Physical	Apartment_Hallway	[D1LC-6]									Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1LC-6]	Nice to finally see you again, Omar.	Day 1	Leah_Coner	Leah_Smile	Dialogue	Apartment_Hallway	[D1LC-7]									Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1LC-7]	Also, you can just call me Leah.	Day 1	Leah_Coner	Leah_Smile	Dialogue	Apartment_Hallway	[D1O-112]									Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1O-112]	Pleasure to finally meet you. Er, sorry if I’m interrupting your evening.	Day 1	Omar	Omar_Happy	Dialogue	Apartment_Hallway	[D1LC-8]									Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1LC-8]	Oh, it's no problem. This is the most excitement I’ve had in weeks. I’ve been having a zombie movie marathon for myself before Halloween.	Day 1	Leah_Coner	Leah_Smile	Dialogue	Apartment_Hallway	[D1O-113]									Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1O-113]	Talk about irony…	Day 1	Omar	Omar_Neutral	Internal	Apartment_Hallway	[D1O-114]									Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1O-114]	Oh, that’s really neat. What’s your favorite zombie movie?	Day 1	Omar	Omar_Happy	Dialogue	Apartment_Hallway	[D1LC-9]									Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1LC-9]	Definitely Plane to Daegu.	Day 1	Leah_Coner	Leah_Smile	Dialogue	Apartment_Hallway	[D1O-115]									Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1O-115]	Oh, good taste.	Day 1	Omar	Omar_Happy	Dialogue	Apartment_Hallway	[D1O-116]									Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1O-116]	We stand there for a moment, smiling in the silence of a first impression, before I break it like an idiot by shoving her blanket towards her.	Day 1	Omar	Omar_Happy	Physical	Apartment_Hallway	[D1LC-10]									Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1LC-10]	Oh, I almost forgot about that. Hehe!	Day 1	Leah_Coner	Leah_Smile	Dialogue	Apartment_Hallway	[D1O-117]									Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1O-117]	I wouldn’t let myself go unless you got it back. It’s a really cool blanket by the way. It was really nice waking up to it.	Day 1	Omar	Omar_Happy	Dialogue	Apartment_Hallway	[D1LC-11]									Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1LC-11]	I had knitted it myself! Anything I make always has my initials on it somewhere in case I lose it. 	Day 1	Leah_Coner	Leah_Smile	Dialogue	Apartment_Hallway	[D1O-118]									Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1O-118]	I get comfortable by leaning against the doorframe as Leah reaches behind her door to show me more things she’s made by hand. Gloves, sweaters, and even some skull caps come and go from view before she shrugs.	Day 1	Omar	Omar_Happy	Physical	Apartment_Hallway	[D1LC-12]									Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1LC-12]	With the little time I do have on my hands, I like to make the most of it.	Day 1	Leah_Coner	Leah_Smile	Dialogue	Apartment_Hallway	[D1O-119									Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1O-119	So why’d you waste your time putting a blanket over a stranger like me?	Day 1	Omar	Omar_Confused	Dialogue	Apartment_Hallway	[D1LC-13]									Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1LC-13]	I wouldn’t call it a waste at all. I saw somebody who looked cold so I gave them a way to warm up. Who better to give a blanket to than a sleeping homeless guy?	Day 1	Leah_Coner	Leah_Smile	Dialogue	Apartment_Hallway	[D1O-120]									Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1O-120]	Not me looking homeless…	Day 1	Omar	Omar_Happy	Dialogue	Apartment_Hallway	[D1LC-14]									Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1LC-14]	Oh! I’m sorry I didn’t mean-- it’s just I don’t know many people who just decide to fall asleep next to their car. What were you doing asleep anyway?	Day 1	Leah_Coner	Leah_Smile	Dialogue	Apartment_Hallway	[D1O-121]									Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1O-121]	I’m actually trying to figure that out. The past three weeks have been kind of a blur. I’ve been trying to retrace my steps all day.	Day 1	Omar	Omar_Neutral	Dialogue	Apartment_Hallway	[D1O-122]									Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1O-122]	You wouldn’t happen to remember somebody from The 13th Pizza delivering here around that time would you?	Day 1	Omar	Omar_Neutral	Dialogue	Apartment_Hallway	[D1LC-15]									Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1LC-15]	Well, I know the people above me always order pizza from you guys.	Day 1	Leah_Coner	Leah_Confused	Dialogue	Apartment_Hallway	[D1LC-16]									Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1LC-16]	Come to think of it, there was a pretty bad argument between a delivery guy and one of the tenants up there. I didn’t see who since it wasn’t any of my business, you know?	Day 1	Leah_Coner	Leah_Confused	Dialogue	Apartment_Hallway	[D1O-123]									Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1O-123]	I nodded along as my eyes looked down, lingering on the pizza in my hand. 	Day 1	Omar	Omar_Neutral	Physical	Apartment_Hallway	[D1O-124]									Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1O-124]	Totally understand. If I was in your shoes around that time, I would’ve done the same thing. Hey, I was wondering, did you maybe want this-	Day 1	Omar	Omar_Bashful	Dialogue	Apartment_Hallway	[D1O-125]									Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1O-125]	From my pocket, the stopwatch on my phone plays the opening notes of Danse Macabre. 	Day 1	Omar	Omar_Shocked	Physical	Apartment_Hallway	[D1O-126]									Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1O-126]	Oh crap, my break is almost over!	Day 1	Omar	Omar_Shocked	Dialogue	Apartment_Hallway	[D1O-127]									Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1O-127]	An idea pops into my head. I feel as if I have to thank her for her help in some way.	Day 1	Omar	Omar_Shocked	Internal	Apartment_Hallway	[D1C5-1]	Do you like pizza?	[D1C5-2]	I gotta go!						Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1C5-1]	Uh, who doesn’t?	Day 1	Leah_Coner	Leah_Smile	Dialogue	Apartment_Hallway	[D1O-128]									Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1O-128]	I pull out the pizza from the bag it was nestled in.	Day 1	Omar	Omar_Happy	Physical	Apartment_Hallway	[D1O-129]									Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1O-129]	Here, it's a 10-inch slasher special pizza.	Day 1	Omar	Omar_Happy	Dialogue	Apartment_Hallway	[D1LC-17]									Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1LC-17]	Oh, but I didn’t order--!	Day 1	Leah_Coner	Leah_Confused	Dialogue	Apartment_Hallway	[D1O-130]									Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1O-130]	Without a second thought, I shove the pizza box into Leah’s hands and dashed to the stairs.	Day 1	Omar	Omar_Happy	Dialogue	Apartment_Hallway	[D1O-131]									Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1O-131]	Thanks for your help, Leah! I’ll talk to you later! Enjoy the pizza! The cheese is also under the sauce!	Day 1	Omar	Omar_Happy	Dialogue	Apartment_Hallway	[D1LC-18]									Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1LC-18]	Oh, okay! Let’s hang out sometimes! I’m free next Friday!	Day 1	Leah_Coner	Leah_Smile	Dialogue	Apartment_Hallway	[D1O-132]									Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1O-132]	I’d like that a lot!	Day 1	Omar	Omar_Happy	Dialogue	Apartment_Hallway	[D1O-134]									Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1C5-2]	Sorry, Leah! I gotta go! It was nice meeting you!	Day 1	Omar	Omar_Shocked	Dialogue	Apartment_Hallway	[D1LC-19]									Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1LC-19]	Nice meeting you too! Glad I could help!	Day 1	Leah_Coner	Leah_Smile	Dialogue	Apartment_Hallway	[D1O-133]									Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1O-133]	I bolt for the stairs and instinctively toss the pizza I had in hand. Any other time I probably would have thought of that as a waste, but now isn’t the time for thinking.	Day 1	Omar	Omar_Shocked	Physical	Apartment_Hallway	[D1O-134]									Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1O-134]	My hands had already grabbed onto the railing before my feet could touch the stairs. Bad reviews were something I could deal with, but I wouldn’t live to even SEE Halloween night if Iggy had to deal with me being late again.	Day 1	Omar	Omar_Neutral	Internal	Apartment_Hallway	[D1O-135]									Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1O-135]	I was in the car and driving out of Woodsboro before I knew it. One day down, two more to go, and I’m right on track to finding my killer! I’d give myself a high-five if they weren’t on the steering wheel.	Day 1	Omar	Omar_Neutral	Internal	Inside_Car	[D1O-136]					Start_Car	Drive_Off			Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1O-136]	I ended up sleeping in my car last night and just drove back to work as soon as I woke up. Figured it was better to not explain my new living situation to my parents and tell them about Spooky Grimmother.	Day 1	Omar	N/A	Internal	Black_screen	[D1O-137]									Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1O-137]	Iggy seemed more at ease since I was back to take some of the workload off of him. I didn’t have the heart to tell him that after tomorrow he probably wouldn’t see me again.	Day 1	Omar	N/A	Internal	Black_screen	[D1O-138]									Nighttime_Ambience	
[D1O-138]	The fear that came with the thought only motivated me to find the killer more. No use curling up into a ball like a baby.	Day 1	Omar	N/A	Internal	Black_screen	[D2O-1]									Nighttime_Ambience	
[D2O-1]	So, here I am. Inside my car, parked inside The Woodsboro Apartments, and having Spooky Grimmother smoke over my shoulder. My new and perfectly normal life for the next couple of hours.	Day 2	Omar	N/A	Internal	Inside_Car										Nighttime_Ambience
